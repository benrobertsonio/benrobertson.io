Hi, I’m Ben! I live in Greenville, SC and work remotely as the Director of Customer Success for [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). In my free time I enjoy hiking, spending time with my wife and children, and learning to play the banjo.

I create fun, innovative, accessible, and fast websites. I try to leave every bit I code I touch more readable, performant and accessible than I found it.

These are the accomplishments I'm most proud of:

 - Speaking at the first ever Gatsby Days conference on [trends in modern web development](https://benrobertson.io/general/trends-in-modern-web-development)
 - Wrote and marketed an [email course on web accessibility](https://benrobertson.io/courses/common-accessibility-mistakes/) to 500+ developers
 - Spearheaded the agency use of pattern libraries at my first job and wrote about it for [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/build-style-guide-straight-sass/).
 - Learned Drupal 7 on the fly, developed an [award-winning Drupal 7 site for the University of Kentucky](https://www.upandup.agency/awards/upup-wins-ucda-excellence-award-university-kentucky-website) and became lead Drupal developer.
 - Led the team at my first job in documenting front-end and server configuration best practices to streamline current development and help onboard new developers.

- **Date:** July 2020
- [Slides](https://noti.st/benrobertson/pfuJPT/magmutual-com-on-the-jamstack-with-gatsby-and-drupal-8)

My colleague Bob Kepford and I shared our decoupled architectural approach to rebuilding <https://www.magmutual.com> on the Jamstack.

It is an inside look at our decoupled approach for MagMutual.com: combining open-source frameworks like Gatsby, Drupal 8, and Serverless, as well as third-party services for user management, a learning management system, and private APIs to build a robust custom platform.


### Gatsby at Mediacurrent

- **Event:** Gatsby for Agencies and Teams: Better, Faster, Smarter Webinar
- **Date:** March 2019
- [Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRntYO4186Y)

In this webinar I shared a little bit about how we've introduced Gatsby into our workflow at Mediacurrent and how things have changed as a result.

I discuss:

- how Gatsby has changed our development process
- how Gatsby has influenced the types of projects we are able to take on
- how even things like hiring and advancement are changing as well

### Move Fast, Don’t Break Things: Trends in Modern Web Dev

- **Event**: Gatsby Days
- **Date**: December 2018
- [Recording](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/gatsby-days-mediacurrent-ben)

In this talk at the first Gatsby Days event, I discuss how trends in modern web development and moving away from "CMS-Centered Development". I share a case study from our first decoupled Drupal and Gatsby project at Mediacurrent.

I also discuss the different ways decoupling can change things at an organization, including the development process, but even beyond into hiring and client diversity.

### Common Accessibility Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

- **Event**: DrupalCamp Asheville
- **Date**: July 2018
- [Recording](https://benrobertson.io/accessibility/common-accessibility-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid-them)

I discussed four of my own homegrown principles for developing accessible websites:

1. Web Design is more than graphic design
2. Be ASAP: As Semantic As Possible
3. Websites should look good naked
4. Talk to your computer (Use ARIA attributes)

I also covered 10 common accessibility mistakes that I come across (and that I’ve personally made), and how to fix them.

### Component Based Development

- **Event**: DrupalCon Nashville
- **Date**: April 2018
- [Overview](https://benrobertson.io/announcements/component-driven-development-ui-patterns)

This full day training session starts with an overview of component-driven development, typical workflows, and benefits for teams and stakeholders, and then we dive deep into the workflow by building out a sample Drupal theme using the UI Patterns approach. We cover:

- An in-depth look at creating patterns including markup, styles, and behaviors
- Composing complex UI patterns by nesting simple patterns in larger patterns
- Integrating front-end patterns with Drupal using the UI Patterns module to simplify the process and preserve Drupal’s baked in goodies
- Advanced workflows with Sass, a Drupal 8 theme generator, incorporating ES6/Babel with patterns
