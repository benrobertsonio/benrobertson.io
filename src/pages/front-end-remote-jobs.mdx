Hi! Thanks for your interest in Front End Remote Jobs (frontendremotejobs.com).

You've landed at this page because I sunset the project at the beginning of 2022.

You might be interested in a couple of blog posts I published on that site:

- [The Cover Letter that Got Me a Remote Front End Developer Job](/remote/cover-letter)

Or you can learn more about what I've been up to [here](/).

## About Front End Remote Jobs

When I was looking for a job back in 2017, I grew tired of filtering through back end and full stack developer jobs. And I was only interested in fully remote work. But there wasn’t a one stop shop for finding remote front end jobs.

I decided to create Front End Remote Jobs to be a curated job site for front end developers. I combed through job listings looking for jobs that are specifically front end and only remote.

I used it as a place to experiment with indie hacking and to get experience working with Gatsby. You can see some of the updates I posted along the way over at [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/product/front-end-remote-jobs).
